☕ Java (Proof of Work)
This repository is a proof of my Java learning journey and hands-on practice.
It contains all the concepts, programs, and mini-implementations I’ve completed while learning Java, organized topic-wise for clarity and consistency.

The goal of this repository is to:

Track my progress in Java

Showcase practical understanding (not just theory)

Build a strong foundation for interviews and real-world projects
